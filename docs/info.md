## How it works
Once the switch is flipped, the display decreases by 1 with every 6000000 ticks of the 100khz clock, or 1 minute, until it reaches 0.

Make sure the switch is turned off. Then press the button until the display shows the desired number of minutes you want to time. Then flip the switch and watch it count down to 0! 
## External hardware
The circuit uses a 2+ digit common cathode seven seg display, a button, and a 3 pin switch.
